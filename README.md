# Ikemen GO Universal Trials Mode - Sample Trials Definition Files
Here you can find trials definition files for some of my favorite characters created for MUGEN and Ikemen GO . 
These trials definition files are compatible with my [Universal Trials Mode Ikemen GO module](https://github.com/two4teezee/Ikemen-GO-Trials-Mode). 
I'll periodically update this repo with new trials definition files.

Each folder contains a `trials.def`.
You'll have to modify the character's main `.def` file to include `trials  = trials.def` under the `[Files]` section, per the .
These sample trials definition files were not created with the character creators' approval, and are simply offered up as tutorials. 
In the event the character creator generates a trials file for their creation, I'll remove it from here.
Otherwise, if you want to download these amazing characters and use the trials definition files I've created, please see links below.
